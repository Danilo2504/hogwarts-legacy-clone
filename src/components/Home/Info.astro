    Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world action RPG set in the world
    first introduced in the Harry Potter books. For the first time, experience

    ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. Now you can
    take control of the action and be at the center of your own adventure in the
    wizarding world. Your legacy is what you make of it.
